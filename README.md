## Project

Before to download the project I just add this image I found in internet that perfectly suits the architecture of this simple project

![Image of architecture](images/Architecture.png)

Ok, now after download the project from the repository, execute the following commands:

```bash
.../phonebook>
    npm install
```

due the mongoDB and babel extensions (compiler to use ES6) execute the following commands to set a proper configuration
```bash
.../backend>
    npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env @babel/node
```

launch mongodb to have access to the data base
```bash
.../backend>
    mongod
```

from a diferent terminal launch the following command
```bash
.../backend>
    npm run dev
```

from a diferent terminal launch the following command
```bash
.../phonebook>
    ng serve -o
```

Now you can test the app on your browser!!!

## Testing

To test the application I use some applications as Postman, or the terminal for some simple test on the data base.
I just put some images to show some tips, for a proper testing I recomend not on ly test about communication between backend and frontend, is recomended to test some basic queries, configurations, test the server, and individual test on the frontend with a final e2e test.
