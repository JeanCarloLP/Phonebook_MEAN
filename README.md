To run a locally installed version of the angular-cli, you can call `ng` commands directly by adding the `.bin` folder within your local `node_modules` folder to your PATH. The `node_modules` and `.bin` folders are created in the directory where `npm install @angular/cli` was run upon completion of the install command.

Alternatively, you can install [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) and run `npx ng <command>` within the local directory where `npm install @angular/cli` was run, which will use the locally installed angular-cli.
